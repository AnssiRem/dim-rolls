# Readme
These text files contain miscellaneous weapon rolls to be used in Destiny 2 Item Manager's wish list feature. I do not actively update these, so there are quite a few missing virtual boomsticks missing. They are also highly biased for my tastes.

The files are sorted into files by season as sunsetting was still a thing when I began making these, but as sunsetting has been sunset I'd imagine I will be making one absolute unit of a file at some point.

## How to use these in DIM?
1. Open your DIM settings page.
2. Load the text files by clicking on *'Load Wish List Rolls'* or by dragging them onto the element.
3. **ALTERNATIVELY**: Paste ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnssiRem/dim-rolls/master/chosen.txt | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnssiRem/dim-rolls/master/hunt.txt | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnssiRem/dim-rolls/master/forsaken.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnssiRem/dim-rolls/master/undying.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnssiRem/dim-rolls/master/arrival.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnssiRem/dim-rolls/master/worthy.txt``` into the URL field and click *'Update Wish List Source'*. (No dowloads necessary!)
